NAME
    Term::Detect - Detect running under terminal (and get terminal emulator
    information)

VERSION
    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
     use Term::Detect qw(detect_terminal);
     say "Running under terminal" if detect_terminal();

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  detect_terminal([$flag]) => ANY
    Return undef if not detected running under terminal.

    Otherwise, return a hash of information, currently includes:

    *   emulator_engine => STR

    *   emulator_software => STR

        Currently Konsole and xterm can be detected through environment
        because they publish some environment variables.

        If $flag contains "p", will execute "pstree" to try to find out
        emulator software from parent process.

    *   color_depth => INT

        Either 0 (does not support ANSI color codes), 16, 256, or 16777216
        (2**24).

    *   default_bgcolor => STR (6-hexdigit RGB)

        For example, any xterm is assumed to have white background (ffffff)
        by default, while Konsole is assumed to have black (000000).

    *   unicode => BOOL

        Whether terminal supports Unicode/wide characters.

TODO
    Better detection of terminal emulator's background color by peeking into
    its configuration.
